Our new music video “The Fire” - a film by Matt Barkin.

The story behind the song is based on a great novel by Denis Johnson, Train Dreams, about a prairie fire that devastates a homesteader family and the recovery and madness of the farmer who returned home to find his house, wife, and child gone.

Watch it here!
