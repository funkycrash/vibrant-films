Check out the Vibrant/Remake team! We got this shot above the Monkey Temple in Kathmandu. It was our pleasure to work with [Remake](http://remake.world/), an ambitious not-for-profit that’s working to curb fast/cheap fashion and the poor labor conditions that go with it. Let’s Remake our world for all!
