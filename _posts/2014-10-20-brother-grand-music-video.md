When Adam and Matt met these guys at an open mic at The Center in lower haight they knew that a collaboration was in order.

Some coffee and a few beers later Ben and Endika came to The Secret Alley and did an incredible live performance for us of their stand-out moody song titled “Alone in the Night”. While the song varies from their normal repertoire we fell in love with it instantly. We hope you enjoy.
