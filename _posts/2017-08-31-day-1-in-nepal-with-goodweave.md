On Day 1 of our shoot with [Goodweave](https://goodweave.org/) in Nepal we had the pleasure of interviewing Uma and her family. Her Children are sponsored by Goodweave so they get to go to a good school in Kathmandu. The slum they lived in was vibrant but very hot and dusty which proved tough for our equipment that kept overheating. Matt Got this shot of them in the shaded Alley outside of their home.

Getting to their home was a journey and a half. We had to pay off local gatekeepers to get into their district and in return we received an amazing ancient piece of paper with stamps on them that guaranteed our safe passage.
